# Bookmarklets
Small bookmarks that helps during a web page development.

## Toggle Design Mode
Toggles the possibility of directly editing a page. All texts become editable.

Good for small previews of text before commiting for a change in the source code.

## Highlight 1 Block
Puts a red border around the element under the cursor.

Useful for knowing what is the size of the element of interest.

## Highlight n Blocks
Puts a red border around the element under the cursor, but doesn't remove them.

## Highlight 10 Blocks
Puts a red border around the last 10 elements under the cursor.

## Colored Background
Puts a, slightly visible, black background to each element.

## Search Archived
Searches the current page on _Wayback Machine_.

Nice for visiting pages that are no longer available.

## AutoLogin
Allows for a automatic insertion of a username and password.

Details:
- The password input field has to be of a `password` type.
- The username input field is the one above the password.
- Any other configuration will not be detected.

Security concerns:
- All bookmarks are stored in a actual file as plain text. That can be stolen by viruses.
- Malicious browser extensions can read bookmarks.
- Phishing pages can steal the inputs as soon as they are given.

Advantages:
- It's safer than copy-paste, since malicious sites can read the clipboard area.
- Nobody expects the bookmark area to contain credentials(That's both good and bad).
- It's convenient.

## Instalation
- Copy the text from the choosen file(The one with a single line).
- In the browser, create or edit a bookmark.
- Paste the text on the URL field.
- Once clicked, the bookmark executes the desired function on the current page.
